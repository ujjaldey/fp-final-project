  * This class holds information about how much each person owns each particular payer.

  * So if we want to know how much people owe to Alice, we can call debtForPayer(Alice) and get
  * a DebtByPayee object with this information. This object should contain an entry for Bob for
  * 10 dollars, and an entry for Charly for 20 dollars.

  * We can also query all the payers included in this object.
