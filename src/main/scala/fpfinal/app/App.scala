/**
  * A command line application to handle expenses among a group of people.
  *
  * It consists of a simple REPL loop which prints the available commands,
  * reads the answer from the user, and executes the selected command.
  *
  * There are five available commands:
  * - Add a person:
  *     The application will ask the user to enter the person's name, it will validate it
  *     and it will add the person to the application state.
  *
  * - Add an expense:
  *     The application will ask the user to enter the name of the payer, the amount in dollars
  *     that was paid, and the people who participated in the expense. After validating the data,
  *     it will add the expense to the application state.
  *
  * - Compute debt:
  *     The application will go through all the expenses in the state and it will calculate how much
  *     people owe each other. Once finished, it will output the results in the console, specifying
  *     for each payer, how much each person owes them.
  *
  * - List all people:
  *     The application will print a list of all the people currently in the state.
  *
  * - Exit the application
  *     The application will show a polite greeting and exit.
  *
  * Validations and other errors will be reported to the user via the console, but the application
  * will continue to run.
