  * TODONE #23: Implement a LiveExpenseService to implement the ExpenseService trait.
  *
  * The addExpense method should add the given expense to the ExpenseState, and return it
  * as it is.
  *
  * The computeDebt method should use the expenses stored in the state and compute
  * a DebtByPayer object. This object contains a summary of how much is owed to each person.
  * Please don't forget to call 'simplified' in the DebtByPayer instance to remove cases where
  * two people owe each other.
  *
  * For example, if A made an expense of 6 dollars where B and C were included, then each owe A 2 dollars.
  * This means the DebtByPayer object will contain an entry for A as a payer. If we call
  * debtForPayer(A) we'll get back a DebtForPayee object with one entry for B (who owes 2 dollars)
  * and one entry for C (who also owes 2 dollars).
  *
  * Check the tests for a concrete example.
